## About Me
Hello! I am Katie Knox, a first-year MCP student at University of Pennsylvania. By undergraduate degree was in computer science and francophone studies at Swarthmore College, and for the past three years I have worked for [National Digital Inclusion Alliance](https://www.digitalinclusion.org/). I am taking this course because I want to learn how to apply data analysis skills towards public interest problems. I just moved from Toronto back to Philadelphia, so go birds!
