## Key Concepts Learned

- Main concepts: 
  - Best practices for coding in R
  - What are algorithms
  - Census data foundations
  - Data Analytics are Subjective
  
- Technical skills covered:
  - dplyr basics practice
  - tidycensus

## Notes

#### Copying labs from MUSA repo to portfolio repo 

- template goes to scripts folder, data goes to data folder 

#### Lab0 / General workflow in R

- Want to avoid "hoarding" tibbles, try not to create a new tibble for every operation
- May way to read in data and store as a 'pristine' version, but then create a working version
- Use piping to string together operations, no need to store in-between temporary tibbles

#### Algorithmic Decision-Making & Census Data 

- Algorithms = set of instructions for solving a problem/completing a task 
- Algorithmic decision-making in government 
	- Systems used to assist or replace human decision-making (humans may be inefficient, flawed/biased)
	- Decisions are made based on predictions from models that process historical data relevant to the decision-making process:
		- Inputs = features = predictors = independent variables = x 
		- Outputs = labels - outcome = dependent variable = y 
	- Examples:
		- Recidivism risk for bail and sentencing decisions
		- Mortgage lending and tenant screening
		- patient care prioritization and health care resource allocation
- Clarifying terms:
	- Data science -> engineering, algorithms, and methods 
	- Data analytic ->applying data science to other disciplines
	- Machine Learning -> algorithms for classification and prediction/regression
	- AI -> Algorithms that adjust and improve across iterations (neural networks, deep learning)
- Gov't data collection historically
	- civic registrations systems
	- census data
	- administration records 
	- operations research -- post-WWII efforts to determine things like the best place for hospitals etc
- New data sources
	- More data available from both official and 'unofficial' or 'accidental' sources like Instagram
	- Turn from explanation to prediction 
	- Messier data 
- Why use algos in gov't?
	- Efficiency - process more cases faster
	- Consistency - same process applied equally (In theory)
	- Objectivity - remove human bias 
	- Cost-saving - remove costly human labors
- Big But -- **Data Analytics are Subjective**
	- At every step, there are human choices:
		- Data cleaning decisions
		- Recoding/classification
		- Data collection biases
		- Imperfect proxies
		- Interpreting results
		- What variables you include in your model 
- Example - Healthcare Algorithm Bias 
	- Algorithm to identify high-risk patients systematically discriminated against Black patients, why?
		- Algo used healthcare cost as a proxy for need (high cost = more risk, less cost = low risk)
		- Problem: black patients incur lower costs because of exclusion from health care and unequal access
	- Result: Black patients were systematically not prioritized 
- Example - COMPAS Recidivism Prediction
	- Algo flagged 2x as likely Black defendants as White as high risk of reoffending, why?
		- Data came from pigs
- Example - Dutch Welfare Fraud Detection
	- Algo disproportionately targeted vulnerable populations 

#### Scenario

- Automated traffic enforcements
	- Highest traffic volume + Mots crashes as proxy for places needing more traffic enforcement 
	- Blind spot -> unreported crashes (folks avoiding insurance fees for instance)
	- Harm -> Could under-enforce actually dangerous intersections, otherwise could be over-enforcement in over-policed areas 
	- Safeguard -> Cap disparities across areas 

#### Census Data Foundations 

- Decennial census mandated by constitution for allocating representative governments 
	- Only 9 questions on 10y census -- age, race, sex, housing 
- ACS 
	- 3% of households surveyed annually 
	- Detailed questions
- 2020 Innovation: Differential Privacy
	- added noise to protect privacy, but this leads to weird edge cases like people living under water 
- Accessing Census Dat ain R 
	- tidycensus !!! hooray
- Structure: 
	- Data organized in tables
	- Each table has multiple variables 
		- ......E = estimate variable
		- .....M = MOE variable 
- Rule of thumb
	- Large MOE : estimate means less reliable
	- Small MOE : estimate means more reliable 
- TIGER/Line Files
	- Geographic shape data not automatically included in ACS tables, need to add on
	- Now released as shapefiles
- Two types of census outputs: 
	- Wide
		- Columns: Tract, Variable_1, Variable_2...
		- i.e. One row per tract 
	- Long
		- Columns: Tract, Var, Value
		- i.e. Tract \* variable number of rows
