Overview\n\n**Learning Objectives:**\n\n- Apply spatial operations to answer policy-relevant research questions\n- Integrate census demographic data with spatial analysis\n- Create publication-quality visualizations and maps\n- Work with spatial data from multiple sources\n- Communicate findings effectively for policy audiences\n\n---\n\n## Part 1: Healthcare Access for Vulnerable Populations\n\n### Research Question\n\n**Which Pennsylvania counties have the highest proportion of vulnerable populations (elderly + low-income) living far from hospitals?**\n\nYour analysis should identify counties that should be priorities for healthcare investment and policy intervention.\n\n### Required Analysis Steps\n\nComplete the following analysis, documenting each step with code and brief explanations:\n\n#### Step 1: Data Collection (5 points)\n\nLoad the required spatial data:\n\n- Pennsylvania county boundaries\n- Pennsylvania hospitals (from lecture data)\n- Pennsylvania census tracts\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load required

Low median household income (choose an appropriate threshold)\n2. Significant elderly population (choose an appropriate threshold)\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Filter for vulnerable tracts based on your criteria\nvulnerable_tracts <- census_tracts %>%\n  filter(median_incomeE < 42398 | (over_65E/total_popE) > .017)\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n\n- What income threshold did you choose and why?\n    - I looked at the [2023 poverty guidelines](https://www.pakeys.org/2023-annual-federal-poverty-guidelines/), the average household size in PA in 2023, which was 2.4, and then looked into eligibility for various programs, which is anywhere from 133% FPIG to 215%. I am going with vulnerable household is 215% or less of the 2-person household FPIG, or $42,398.\n- What elderly population threshold did you choose and why?\n    - In order to control for overall population size, instead of looking at the raw number of elderly, I looked at the over 65 as percent of total population. I defined vulnerable as any tract in the 75th percentile of elderly percent of tract population (1.7% or above).\n- How many tracts meet your vulnerability criteria?\n    - 1,145\n- What percentage of PA census tracts are considered vulnerable by your definition?\n    - 33.2% -- about a third. \n\n---\n\n#### Step 4: Calculate Distance to Hospitals \n\nFor each vulnerable tract, calculate the distance to the nearest hospital.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#convert to Albers\nvulnerable_tracts <- st_transform(vulnerable_tracts, crs = 5070)\nhospitals <- st_transform(hospitals, crs = 5070)\n\n# Calculate distance from each tract centroid to nearest hospital\ntract_centroids <- st_centroid(vulnerable_tracts)\nnearest_hospital <- st_nearest_feature(tract_centroids, hospitals)\n\nvulnerable_tracts <- vulnerable_tracts %>%\n  mutate(nearest_hospital_geom = hospitals$geometry[nearest_hospital])\n\nvulnerable_tracts <- vulnerable_tracts %>%\n  mutate(distance_to_nearst_hospital = set_units(st_distance(tract_centroids, vulnerable_tracts$nearest_hospital_geom, by_element = TRUE), \"mi\"))\n\nsummary(vulnerable_tracts$distance_to_nearst_hospital) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n    Min.  1st Qu.

counties have the highest percentage of underserved vulnerable tracts?\n    - Sullivan\n    - Juniata\n    - Pike\n    - Cameron\n    - Snyder\n- Which counties have the most vulnerable people living far from hospitals?\n    - Clearfield\n    - Chester\n    - Pike\n    - Erie\n    - Cumberland\n- Are there any patterns in where underserved counties are located?\n    - There are a lot of quite rural underserved counties, like Sullivan, Juniata, and Clearfield, but there are also suburban counties of major PA cities like Chester County outside of Philadelphia and Cumberland County outside Harrisburg and Erie County which includes Erie. \n\n---\n\n#### Step 7: Create Summary Table \n\nCreate a professional table showing the top 10 priority counties for healthcare investment.\n\n**Your
