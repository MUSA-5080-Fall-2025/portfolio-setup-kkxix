Before that, hospitals were also in WGS84, but census tracts were in NAD83. \n\n---\n\n#### Step 2: Get Demographic Data \n\nUse `tidycensus` to download tract-level demographic data for Pennsylvania.\n\n**Required variables:**\n\n- Total population\n- Median household income\n- Population 65 years and over (you may need to sum multiple age categories)\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Get demographic data from ACS\npa_tracts_data <- get_acs(\n  geography = \"tract\",\n  variables = c(\n    median_income = \"B19013_001\",\n    total_pop = \"B01003_001\",\n    over_65 = \"B01001_020\"  # Population 65 years and over\n  ),\n  state = \"PA\",\n  year = 2023,\n  output = \"wide\"\n)\n\n# Join to tract boundaries\ncensus_tracts <- census_tracts %>%\n  left_join(pa_tracts_data, by= \"GEOID\")\n\nsummary(census_tracts)\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n\n- What year of ACS data are you using?\n  - 2019-2023 5-year ACS data\n- How many tracts have missing income data?\n  - 65\n- What is the median income across all PA census tracts?\n  - $72,944\n\n\n---\n\n#### Step 3: Define Vulnerable Populations \n\nIdentify census tracts with vulnerable populations based on TWO criteria:\n\n1. Low median household income (choose an appropriate threshold)\n2. Significant elderly population (choose an appropriate threshold)\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Filter for vulnerable tracts based on your criteria\nvulnerable_tracts <- census_tracts %>%\n  filter(median_incomeE < 42398 | (over_65E/total_popE) > .017)\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n\n- What income threshold did you choose and why?\n    - I looked at the [2023 poverty guidelines](https://www.pakeys.org/2023-annual-federal-poverty-guidelines/), the average household size in PA in 2023, which was 2.4, and then looked into eligibility for various programs, which is anywhere from 133% FPIG to 215%. I am going with vulnerable household is 215% or less of the 2-person household FPIG, or $42,398.\n- What elderly population threshold did you choose and why?\n    - In order to control for overall population size, instead of looking at the raw number of elderly, I looked at the over 65 as percent of total population. I defined vulnerable as any tract in the 75th percentile of elderly percent of tract population (1.7% or above).\n- How many tracts meet your vulnerability criteria?\n    - 1,145\n- What percentage of PA census tracts are considered vulnerable by your definition?\n    - 33.2% -- about a third. \n\n---\n\n#### Step 4: Calculate Distance to Hospitals \n\nFor each vulnerable tract, calculate the distance to the nearest hospital.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#convert to Albers\nvulnerable_tracts <- st_transform(vulnerable_tracts, crs = 5070)\nhospitals <- st_transform(hospitals, crs = 5070)\n\n# Calculate distance from each tract centroid to nearest hospital\ntract_centroids <- st_centroid(vulnerable_tracts)\nnearest_hospital <- st_nearest_feature(tract_centroids, hospitals)\n\nvulnerable_tracts <- vulnerable_tracts %>%\n  mutate(nearest_hospital_geom = hospitals$geometry[nearest_hospital])\n\nvulnerable_tracts <- vulnerable_tracts %>%\n  mutate(distance_to_nearst_hospital = set_units(st_distance(tract_centroids, vulnerable_tracts$nearest_hospital_geom, by_element = TRUE), \"mi\"))\n\nsummary(vulnerable_tracts$distance_to_nearst_hospital) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n    Min.  1st Qu.   Median     Mean  3rd Qu.     Max. \n 0.02107  1.21850  2.75761  4.37494  6.02931 29.75156 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Requirements:**\n\n- Use an appropriate projected coordinate system for Pennsylvania\n- Calculate distances in miles\n- Explain why you chose your projection\n\nI chose Albers Conical Equal Area, NAD 83 projection based on [this PA document from 2011's](https://elibrary.dcnr.pa.gov/PDFProvider.ashx?action=PDFStream&docID=1743537&chksum=&revision=0&docName=ndards&nativeExt=pdf&PromptToSave=False&Size=152488&ViewerMode=2&overlay=0) recommendation. \n\n**Questions to answer:**\n\n- What is the average distance to the nearest hospital for vulnerable tracts?\n    - 4.4 miles\n- What is the maximum distance?\n    - 29.8 miles\n- How many vulnerable tracts are more than 15 miles from the nearest hospital?\n    - 33\n\n---\n\n#### Step 5: Identify Underserved Areas \n\nDefine \"underserved\" as vulnerable tracts that are more than 15 miles from the nearest hospital.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create underserved variable\n\nvulnerable_tracts <- vulnerable_tracts %>%\n  mutate(underserved = ifelse(as.numeric(distance_to_nearst_hospital) > 15,\"Underserved\",\"\"))\n\nvulnerable_tracts %>%\n  group_by(underserved)%>%\n  summarise(n())\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n\n- How many tracts are under-served?\n    - 33\n- What percentage of vulnerable tracts are under-served?\n    - 3%\n- Does this surprise you? Why or why not?\n    - Unfortunately, this does not surprise me, given how rural certain areas of Pennsylvania are and knowing how rural healthcare is a persistent issue in the US in general. However, it would surprise me if some of these tracts are in urban areas. \n\n---\n\n#### Step 6: Aggregate to County Level\n\nUse spatial joins and aggregation to calculate county-level statistics about vulnerable populations and hospital access.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Spatial join tracts to counties\npa_counties <- pa_counties %>% st_transform(st_crs(vulnerable_tracts))\n\nvulnerable_per_county <- vulnerable_tracts %>%\n  st_join(pa_counties) %>%\n  st_drop_geometry()\n\n# Aggregate statistics by county\nvulnerable_per_county_stats <- vulnerable_per_county %>%\n  group_by(COUNTY_NAM) %>%\n  summarise(\n    num_vulnerable_tracts = n(),\n    num_underserved_tracts = sum(underserved == \"Underserved\"),\n    percent_underserved = sum(underserved == \"Underserved\")/n(),\n    avg_distance_to_nearst_hospital = mean(distance_to_nearst_hospital),\n    total_pop = sum(total_popE),\n    total_underserved_pop = sum(ifelse(underserved == \"Underserved\", total_popE, 0))\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Required county-level statistics:**\n\n- Number of vulnerable tracts\n- Number of underserved tracts  \n- Percentage of vulnerable tracts that are underserved\n- Average distance to nearest hospital for vulnerable tracts\n- Total vulnerable population\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n\n- Which 5 counties have the highest percentage of underserved vulnerable tracts?\n    - Cameron\n    - Juniata\n    - Potter\n    - Snyder\n    - Sullivan\n- Which counties have the most vulnerable people living far from hospitals?\n    - Clearfield\n    - Chester\n    - Juniata\n    - Snyder\n    - Pike\n- Are there any patterns in where underserved counties are located?\n    - There are a lot of quite rural underserved counties, like Sullivan, Juniata, and Clearfield, but there are also suburban counties of major PA cities like Chester County outside of Philadelphia and Cumberland County outside Harrisburg. \n\n---\n\n#### Step 7: Create Summary Table \n\nCreate a professional table showing the top 10 priority counties for healthcare investment.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create and format priority counties table\nvulnerable_per_county_stats %>% \n  arrange(desc(total_underserved_pop)) %>%\n  slice_head(n = 10) %>%\n  select(\n    c(\"COUNTY_NAM\", \"total_underserved_pop\", \"percent_underserved\", \"avg_distance_to_nearst_hospital\")\n  ) %>%\n  mutate(\n    avg_distance_to_nearst_hospital = as.numeric(avg_distance_to_nearst_hospital),\n    percent_underserved = paste0(round(percent_underserved*100, 2), \"%\")\n  )%>%\n  kable(\n    col.names = c(\"County\", \"Total Underserved

That shows that these regions have more tracts that are facing very different needs that the middle 50% of the region.\n\n\n**Suggested chart types:**\n\n- Histogram or density plot of distances\n- Box plot comparing distances across regions\n- Bar chart of underserved tracts by county\n- Scatter plot of distance vs. vulnerable population size\n\n**Requirements:**\n\n- Clear axes labels with units\n- Appropriate title\n- Professional formatting\n- Brief interpretation (1-2 sentences as a caption or in text)\n\n---\n\n## Part 3: Bring Your Own Data Analysis \n\nChoose your own additional spatial dataset and conduct a supplementary analysis.\n\n### Challenge Options\n\nChoose ONE of the following challenge exercises, or propose your own research question using OpenDataPhilly data (https://opendataphilly.org/datasets/). \n\n\n---\n\n\n### Your Analysis\n\n#### Digital Justice\n\n- **Data:** Census Broadband access, device access, and income, Philadelphia free wifi spots from OpenDataPhilly\n- **Question:** \"Do digitally disadvantaged neighborhoods have equitable access to city internet?\"\n- **Operations:** Buffer free wifi spots with a computer (10-minute walk = 0.5 mile), calculate connectivity by tract, determine digitally vulnerable tracts from census data and underserved tracts by distance from buffers. \n- **Policy relevance:** Digital equity, broadband infrastructure, internet-connected device access\n\n1. **Find and load additional data**\n\n   - Document your data source\n   - Check and standardize the CRS\n   - Provide basic summary statistics\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load your additional dataset\nv21 <- load_variables(2023, \"acs5\", cache = TRUE)\n\n# Search for broadband and computer-related variables\nbb_vars <- v21 %>% filter(str_detect(label, \"broadband\"))\ncomp_vars <-v21 %>% filter(str_detect(label, \"computer\"))\n\n#B28003_002 = total with computer\n#B28002_004 = total with broadband internet subscription\n\nphilly_digital_access <-  get_acs(\n  geography = \"tract\",\n  variables = c(\n    total_pop = \"B01003_001\",\n    has_computer = \"B28003_002\", \n    has_broadband = \"B28002_004\"\n  ),\n  state = \"PA\",\n  county = \"Philadelphia\",\n  year = 2023,\n  output = \"wide\"\n)\n\nfree_wifi_spots <- st_read(\"data/free_city_wifi_locations.shp\")%>%st_transform(2272)\n\nphilly_digital_access <- left_join(\n  philly_digital_access,\n  census_tracts,\n  by=\"GEOID\"\n) %>%\n  st_as_sf() %>%\n  st_transform(2272)\n\nggplot(philly_digital_access)+\n  geom_sf()+\n  geom_sf(\n    data=free_wifi_spots\n  )+\n  theme_void()+\n  labs(\n    title = \"Free Wi-Fi Spots in Philadelphia\",\n    caption =\"Data Sources: US Census Data, OpenDataPhilly\"\n  ) +\n  annotation_north_arrow(             \n    location = \"br\",                  \n    which_north = \"true\",\n    style = north_arrow_minimal\n  ) +\n  theme_void() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"right\",\n    legend.direction = \"vertical\",\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 12),\n    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 9, margin = margin(t = 10))\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n\n- What dataset did you choose and why?\n  - I choose the ACS variables showing whether a household has broadband access and whether they have a computer, as well as OpenDataPhilly's database of free wi-fi locations, which inlcudes a variable showing how many public use computers are available at the location. \n- What is the data source and date?\n  - The ACS data is 5-year data from 2018 - 2023, and the wi-fi locations are from 2024, so the home broadband and computer access data may be slightly outdated. Also important to note is 2018 - 2023 range includes the pandemic, a period in which there was unprecedented investment in home internet subsidies that have expired in 2024 [Affordable Connectivity Program](https://technical.ly/civic-news/affordable-connectivity-program-ending-comcast-verizon-congress-act/).\n- How many features does it contain?\n  - There are 254 free-wifi locations, and 408 census tracts in Philadelphia. \n- What CRS is it in? Did you need to transform it?\n  - Before transformation, both datasets were in web mercator, EPSG 3857, and since Philly falls within southern pennsylvania, I transformed it to Pennsylvania South state plane projection, EPSG 2272. \n  \n---\n\n2. **Pose a research question**\n\nDo digitally vulnerable tracts have adequate access to free wifi spots with computers?\n\n---\n\n3. **Conduct spatial analysis**\n\nUse at least TWO spatial operations to answer your research question.\n\n**Required operations (choose 2+):**\n\n- Buffers\n- Spatial joins\n- Spatial filtering with predicates\n- Distance calculations\n- Intersections or unions\n- Point-in-polygon aggregation\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Your spatial analysis\n\n#Filter Philly census tracts by the most digitally vulnerable: in the top quartile of percent of tract that has no home broadband or top quartile of percent of tract with no computer. \nphilly_digital_access <- philly_digital_access %>%\n  mutate(\n    percent_no_bb = (1-has_broadbandE/total_popE.x)*100,\n    percent_no_comp = (1-has_computerE/total_popE.x)*100\n  )\n\nsummary(philly_digital_access$percent_no_bb)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n   Min. 1st Qu.

There are 30 total tracts in Philly that completely fall outside walking distance to a Wi-Fi computer center, mostly concentrated in North Philadelphia. The estimated number of households in these 30 tracts without broadband is 103,418 and without a computer is 100,478. The average distance from these underserved tracts to the nearest free Wi-Fi and computer center is 7 miles.\n\nThe internet has become indispensable to most educational, workforce, social, and civic needs, and thus policy should primarily aim to enable every person to have home broadband and a computer. However, while that may be a long-term goal, free Wi-Fi and computer centers help bridge the gap. Thus they should prioritize locations as close as possible to the most digitally vulnerable areas of Philadelphia, seeing as a longer commute to these centers will compound the barriers already faced by not having broadband or a computer at home. \n\n\n## Finally - A few comments about your incorporation of feedback!\n\nTaking feedback into account, I have hidden sensitive code blocks and hidden lengthy console output that is not essential to interpreting my work!\n\n---\n\n## Submission Requirements\n\n**What to submit:**\n\n1. **Rendered HTML document posted to your course portfolio** with all code, outputs, maps, and text\n   - Use `embed-resources: true` in YAML so it's a single file\n   - All code should run without errors\n   - All maps and charts should display correctly\n\n**File naming:** `LastName_FirstName_Assignment2.html` and `LastName_FirstName_Assignment2.qmd`\n\n---\n\n",
